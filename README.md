# Program script for master thesis in computer science, Ralf Bartho 02. Feb 2024
Please note that there are very small deviations from the code documented in the thesis. 
The parameter "reg" has been renamed to "reg_type" and "lambd" has been renamed to "reg_strength" for easier reading.
All functions have been integrated into the main class "OrdReg", so that repeating arguments like
like reg_strength or reg_type do not have to be passed through each function.
